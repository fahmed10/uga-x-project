# UGA Hacks X Project

## Team Members
- Jacob Groover

## Purpose
Our team built this 2D top down multiplayer fighting game with the purpose of making a fun, rock and roll themed game for people to play.

## Tools Utilized
- Piskel
- LMMS

## Problems
- **Packet loss in server-client connection:** We made the server send packets multiple times to make sure that the client received them.
- **Dependencies not being shared:** We used maven to keep everyone's dependencies on the same version to keep the project working properly.

## Frameworks Used
- JavaFX
